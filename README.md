Hello, well to get started a account might help but i am gonna show you how to do stuff lmao.

How to edit a file
---
Pretty much you have to make Repository, its pretty much a file that you can code in.

After doing that you should name it something lmao.

After naimg it and creating a description of some sort you should see alot of stuff like pull request code ect.

I can confirm to start off you don't need them execpt code and pull request but we will get to that later.

When you open your repository you should see your title of it ect, on the far left of it is a pencil click that then edit file.

And boom you can write whatever or put a meme in there.

How to create a pull request
---
You have to make a new branch and call it whatever after making a branch and going to that and editing it you can do whatever like delete everything or add picture.

After that press pull request.

What that does is send a message to the main branch that you want to merge.

Note: If someone is the head of the project then the request goes to them if its just you cause you have no friends that it just says to confirm merge.

After that boom you can delete your branch you made and all your hard work or meme goes to the main branch.

All set

You now know your way around that it gets harder but this is just the basics and with this you can do what ever you want.

So enjoy.
